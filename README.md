## Installation

### Requirements

- Python >= 3.5
- numpy >= 1.17.3

### How to Install

Installing the package using pip

`pip install -e <path to pyLCR>/pyLCR`

### How to Uninstall

Uninstalling the package using pip

`pip uninstall pyLCR`

## Usage

Downloading data for a specific source

`data = pyLCR.getLightCurve('4FGL J0001.2-0747', cadence='daily', flux_type='photon', index_type='fixed', ts_min=4)`

Note that the cadence refers to the binning timescale, with the options including 'daily', 'weekly', or 'monthly'. The flux_type refers to the units in which the flux is returned, with the options including 'photon' flux in units of photons cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> or 'energy' flux in units of MeV cm<sup>-2</sup> <sup>-1</sup>. The index_type refers to whether the spectral index of the source was 'fixed' or 'free' during the spectral fit.

Plotting data for a specific source

`pyLCR.plotLightCurve(data, plotTS=True, plotIndex=True)`
